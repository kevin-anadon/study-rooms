## Front-end Stack üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

Our front-end is built using a combination of powerful technologies to ensure a seamless user experience.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: A responsive UI framework that facilitates quick and effective web design.
- **ViteJS**: A fast build tool and development server that enhances our development workflow.

To run the front-end locally:

1. Navigate to the `client` folder: `cd client`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:5000`

## Back-end Stack üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

The back-end of our platform is designed to handle various functionalities while maintaining robustness and scalability.

- **NodeJS with TypeScript**: We leverage the server-side capabilities of NodeJS, enhancing it with TypeScript for type-safe development.
- **ExpressJS**: A flexible web application framework for NodeJS that helps us build APIs and manage routes effectively.

To run the back-end locally:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder: `cd server`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3001`

## Web Communication Stack üåé

Smooth communication is crucial for a collaborative environment, and we employ the following technologies to ensure seamless interactions.

- **WebRTC using PeerJS**: We enable video and audio communication through WebRTC technology, powered by the PeerJS library.
- **WebSockets with Socket.IO**: For real-time chat functionality, we utilize WebSockets, implementing them with the Socket.IO library.

## Deployment üíª

Efficient deployment ensures that our platform is accessible to users reliably. We utilize the following services for deployment:

- **Front-end**: Netlify provides us with a straightforward and efficient way to deploy our front-end, ensuring fast and reliable access.
- **Back-end**: Render offers a reliable platform to deploy our back-end, ensuring stability and scalability as our user base grows.
